      <![CDATA[
      The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol is a
      "language" which defines specific kinds of electronic messages
      for communicating securities transactions between two parties.  
      FIX defines only the format of the messages and the
      session-level interaction between two applications. More
      information on FIX can be found at the 
      <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/">FIX protocol web site</a>.

    <section title="Future of QuickFIX">
      <![CDATA[
      <p>
      QuickFIX has already proven itself as a viable, and often
      preferable, alternative to both commercial and proprietary FIX
      engines.  Not only are little guys flocking to it due to it's
      cheap price (free), but the big guys are just as interested due
      to the outstanding flexibility that comes with no strings
      attached access to the source code.
      </p>
      <p>
      But QuickFIX does not rely on cost to be
      relevant. For many companies, their FIX interface is the primary
      public presentation of their technology based services. It is how they say
      "<i>hey look what we can do!</i>". To have people put their faith in
      QuickFIX is a demonstration that they have faith in it's
      quality.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've seen the process of many companies, large and small, go
      through the adoption process of a FIX engine. What is
      interesting about QuickFIX is where the adoption has it's
      roots... <b>software developers</b>. QuickFIX has been so
      sucessful because software developers have downloaded it, used
      it, liked it, and convinced management that this is the way to
      go. Software teams cannot underestimate the impact they can
      have on their organization. This industry has so rapidly
      adopted technology that the technologist have an unusual amount
      of influence not found in many other industries.
      </p>
      <p>
      Why does QuickFIX garner so much grass roots support? Opening
      up the source code is part of it, but that is only the
      start. It is really the over all culture of openess that
      QuickFIX enourages. Not only do we open up the source code, we
      open up our developement methods, the tools we use, the
      automated tests we run, the community we create which each and
      every one of you has an opportunity to contribute to, and of
      course the future direction we decide to take.
      </p>
      <p>
      More than two years after releasing QuickFIX I am now asking
      myself, for the first time really, <b>what now?</b>. When starting
      out the project, the goal was obvious: To create a fully
      functional, non-crippled, open implementation of the FIX
      protocol (<i>after all, an open protocol deserves an open
      implementation, does it not?</i>). It was intended to act as an
      alternative, or a complement to, existing FIX engines. Having
      seen this come to fruition, I am now eager to see what our
      longer term impact will be.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the past few months I've had a real shift in
      perspective. I have since become one of the many users of
      QuickFIX. Yes, I had helped others establish QuickFIX
      installations before, but now I use and maintain it for my
      own purposes. My hope is that this experience will enlighten me
      somewhat. So I have outlined a few goals. These are some
      initial thoughts which I hope will kick off some discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
      <br/><u>More Transparency</u><br/>
      We need to get better visibility into the system. The logs are
      a great start, but we should be able to learn more about what
      is going on. What sessions are available? Who is logged on?
      What are my sequence numbers? These are generally available in
      files or databases but can be hard to aggregate and get at in a
      moments notice. This information and more should be quickly and
      easily retrieved.<br/>
      <br/><u>More Control</u><br/>
      QuickFIX should become more dynamic. Let's have the ability to
      modify the sequence numbers, add and remove sessions, and
      modify the session times without taking down the engine. We
      should have the ability to modify the configuration file and
      have QuickFIX reconfigure itself while it's running.<br/>
      <br/><u>Simplify Installation</u><br/>
      Let's lower the learning curve. Part of this is to improve the
      quality and depth of our documentation, but more of it is to
      just make it more intuitive. Have project templates for
      different application types in all supported API
      languages. Supply binary distributions that can be installed in
      one step. Have more <i>useful</i> example applications that
      demonstrate how to create applications and can be used to solve
      real world problems.<br/>
      <br/><u>Keep It Pure</u><br/>
      QuickFIX is a FIX Engine. The real core that implements the
      protocol. It is not a so called enterprise solution. We
      shouldn't clog with layers that increase complexity and can
      make us lose sight of our purpose. Let's keep it simple and
      elegant. And in this simplicity and elegance will come a power
      and flexibility unmatched from more bloated solutions.<br/>
      <br/><u>Build Tools <i>Around</i> QuickFIX / FIX</u><br/>
      That being said, we should not shy away from building powerful
      tools around the core engine. The kinds of tools that make up
      enterprise solutions. These tools should be kept in modules
      separated from the main quickfix module. Let's create the log
      viewers, control panels, and other tools that will be useful in
      administering QuickFIX or any FIX installation. Let's just keep
      them logically separate from the base engine. The
      should <i>use</i> QuickFIX, not <i>be</i> QuickFIX.<br/>
      <br/><u>Add Scripting Support</u><br/>
      Powerful tools and capabilities can be added with support for a
      modern scripting language like Ruby or Python. So many great
      utilities and applications could be developed much more rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition to these, we should continue to create necessary
      functionality like more flexible session times, additional
      database support, and more transports like tibco. Now I know
      many of are right now screaming <b><i>"What about a pure Java
      implementation!!!"</i></b> To be perfectly honest I'm quite
      torn about this. I know many people want this but I'm not sure
      if this is yet the time or if we have the proper framework in
      place to support two implementations of the same detailed
      session logic. I realize it will be a big usability win for
      many people, but I believe pre-built binaries is a good step to
      eliminate some of those issues. Of course there are the issues
      with the flakiness of JNI (which is really just due to the
      extreme difficulty of getting it right). These issues seem to
      have subsided with newer releases as we learned more about the
      issues involved. I'm sure I will hear many opinions on this and
      I would like to hear them as this may be a bigger issues with
      bigger reasons then I am currently aware of.

      <![CDATA[
      QuickFIX will not run correctly when compiled
      with gcc 2.9.6. Some linux distributions  such as RedHat 7.3
      include this compiler. That version is a development snapshot
      and not a real  release. See this 
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html">note</a> from the gcc
      team why this compiler should not be used for production systems.
      <br/><br/>
      If you are compiling on a multi-processor machine, you can't
      safely compile QuickFIX  with gcc 2.95.x

      We created a parser to go through the HTML version of the FIX
      specs and generated well formed XML versions of the specs. We
      use this XML version to generate most of the code for our FIX
      engine. Seeing as though it is so useful for us, we figured
      other people might be interested too.
     <br/><br/>
      This is a <i>machine readable</i> version of the FIX
      specification. If you have been looking for such a thing, this
